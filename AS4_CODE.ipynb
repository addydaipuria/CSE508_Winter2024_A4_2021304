      "Original Review: This product was remmended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome IBS). I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him Friskies\" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a uple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools diarrhea and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy ~ lbs) but now he is down to , after about months on Hill's. Thumbs up and stars for this product\n",

      "Original Review: BUT, I'm on a very restrictive diet that doesn't allow for the usual autumny, spicy, baked goods one of the many reasons fall is my favorite time of year. I was highly skeptical of the quality of this, since most flavored ffees are irritatingly perfumy with no real increase in flavor. To top that off, I don't even LIKE light ffees and have always been a bold girl. This ffee was purchased purely on whim one night when I was craving something with pumpkin spice. Much to my surprise, this ffee has turned out to be a hit. It's not a five-star, knock my socks off ffee, but pretty darn close The pumpkin and spice with the ffee aroma and flavor are perfectly balanced.

I ok a medium pot which lasts us all week. Just heat them up for about minutes on low or microwave on medium high) and you have the best oatmeal on the planet. I frequently charge it up with dried cranberries, fresh frozen blueberries, strawberries, chunks of apple and cinnamon and even chopped nuts, sunflower seeds and ground flax seeds. This oatmeal is not mushy but neither is it hard. The texture is chewy and the flavor is awesome. My husband and I are hooked and keep our cupboard well stocked with this healthy breakfast food. We even eat it as a light snack at night with a bit of maple syrup when we crave something sweet. For anyone who loves oatmeal, this is the one to try.\n",

I am on my send day and so far I had enough milk and some extra. I eat about hand fools of walnuts a day. My husband said it takes time for herbs to get into my system and seeing that its helping more moms, I will finish up the bottles and see if it will give me more milk.

      "Original Review: I have a yorkie/Maltese and she is very sensitive to food. She was under weight and had rashes from regular dog food. She would throw up some and had runny poop. I tried this product as well as some higher priced products for a month each and then decided on this one due to the results and price. Bonnie puppy is now a healthy weight and her skin rash has cleared up. Highly remmended for any pet with digestive problems and or skin issues. Maltese breeds have highly sensitive systems so if u are having digestive system problems then u should read up on your breed and see if it is a food allergy. This product worked for my brothers Maltese as well that was underweight. Ended up being a digestion issue.\n",

      "Original Review: Zevia drinks have been my favorite alternative to sugary or diet drinks. I like all the flavors I've tried but I really loved the Root Beer flavor. It reminds me of when I was a kid and enjoyed root beer floats. This is however a more mplex drink with the natural flavors of wintergreen oil, anise oil, lemon oil, orange oil and ginger extract. This does ntain citric acid which can cause tooth damage if you drink it too often. I think it is safe to say that this drink won't harm you if you only drink it now and then. My little Eat Safe handbook also says that Erythritol is safe at low levels. When you think of the dangers of eating too much sugar or artificial sweeteners then this drink starts to look pretty darn good. But drink in moderation. The problem with the ginger root beer flavor is that you will want two cans at a time. It really is that good.<br ><br >~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "Original Review: There are a few things that I look for in a bottled drinking water. One is oxygenation which a few bottled water mpanies put out. Pente water is my favorite of this kind and has stabilized medicinal grade oxygen). Oxygen tends to alkalize. Two is a Ph balanced water. Essentia is my favorite one of these. I find that I drink the whole bottle very quickly, because it satisfies a need. The body likes the balance that it gives. It helps rehydrate and for the body to remove toxins. One of the curious ways that this shows up is that when I drink a ph balanced water, I tend to go to the bathroom very soon afterwards and you can tell from the urine lor and from how much the urine bubbles\" that it is removing toxins). It seems to move through the body quicker. When my father needed to alkalize, I had remmended that he take Pente water. But he uld not find it where he was and he stumbled on Essentia water and found it worked for him and got similar results to Pente water. I got a bottle of the Essentia water from the Amazon review program partly because it had worked for my father. I uld taste the difference, taste the minerals that made it more alkaline. It felt slightly thicker than regular water and slightly smoother. I drank up the whole . liter bottle within less than an hour because it felt like it was satisfying a need inside me. If I had to choose, I would probably still pick some Pente water over the Essentia water, because the oxygen still alkalizes and has other benefits from the oxygen itself. But Essentia would be my send choice. If I was stocking up, however, I would get both of them. My guess is that there different approaches to alkalizing would make them mplimentary.\n",

My super smart, very litter trained cat got mpletely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br ><br >At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.m. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br ><br >I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some ncerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly uldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br ><br >I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly remmend this food for the health of your cat.<br ><br >Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to ver up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have vered them and allowed them to retain their moisture.\n",

      "Original Review: I cannot stress enough what a picky eater my cat is. Just to get her to eat more than a quarter of a . oz can of food at a time is quite the ordeal. For some time, I had to mix Nutri-cal with her food, because she is tiny for her age and isn't gaining weight at the rate she should be she is a kitten). I was just about to settle with Earthborn Holistic canned chicken, as she seemed to like it more than any other food I had tried feeding her. It also appeared and smelled far less disgusting to me than the mush that mes in most cans; the nsistency of the Earthborn is chicken shreds in gravy, which my cat seems to prefer. But as I was browsing in the cat food section today, I noticed Weruva Paw-lickin Chicken and picked it up to try because acrding to the description, it seemed that it would have the same nsistency as Earthborn. It's also Grain-free and has no veggies only this flavor is veggie free though) like Earthborn. And it sts the same, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult financially to switch over to Weruva, if she happens to like it.<br ><br >When I opened the can of Weruva today, I immediately noticed that the quality of this food is even better than Earthborn. The formula is almost soupy, with thinner shreds, which are easier for my kitten to chew and swallow. The smell is VERY tolerable and it actually looks like food a human would eat. The BEST part however is that she ate almost ALL of the oz can. I was so shocked to see that once she was done eating what I spooned into her bowl, she went over the open can and began eating.<br ><br >I was a bit ncerned initially when I noticed that even though the food is not described as adult food, in the back in small print it says it is for adult nutrition. However, acrding to Weruva's website, it is fine to feed it to kittens. The only difference between adult food and kitten food apparently, is that kitten food is supposed to ntain more protein, because they need more for their growing bodies. But if fed a sufficient amount, this food, especially because it is very protein rich to begin with, provides mplete nutrition for kittens as well. Seeing how much she ate nfirms that.<br ><br >My only ncern with this food, which is any person's ncern with any premium quality food is the price. These foods ARE pricey and it can be difficult to justify spending so much on cat food, but if you can afford it, the benefits of premium quality foods those that are byproduct and grain free, and preferably veggie free) are:<br ><br >-Their poop bemes significantly less stinky. The difference is very noticeable.<br >-The food itself doesn't smell so bad. And this really depends on what type of meat and nsistency you buy as well. If you buy a chicken or turkey flavor food, it will be less smelly than a fish food. I don't see the point in feeding your cat fish other than as an occassional treat if she likes it, because it ntains some levels of mercury and is not as nutritious to begin with. I've noticed that the mushy formula food smells nsiderably worse than the gravy foods. Also, I understand that cat foods are smelly because cats will only eat food that has a very strong smell, but that being said, there's a difference between a stench that permeates your room and a smell that remains ncentrated in the general area where the food itself is.<br >-You end up saving money on vet bills, because these foods provide superior nutrition and a healthy animal is less likely to be a sickly animal.\n",

      "Original Review: Here is my rant on the new\" Kraft Catalina dressing. It is the vilest and nastiest stuff I've ever put in my mouth I HATE it I called to mplain on their number and the minimum-wage phone jerk told me how they put all their products under taste testing samples and market research. Well, those people they tested must not have any taste buds. Regardless, we don't have Catalina dressing anymore and I don't believe that Kraft is going to listen to us. While this decision is similar to the Coca-Cola disaster in , it doesn't have the same enomic impact that the Coke had. Millions of people don't nsume Catalina every send of every day like Coke does, so while Kraft might notice some sales declines, I think their stubborn, marketing-minded mentality will keep the new product on the shelves. Too many rporations these days are more ncerned with dollars and new and improved\" products than maintaining tried-and-true products with loyal customers. These rporations are being infiltrated with young llege graduates who don't know, nor care, about value and time-honored traditions. For them, everything is about dumping the old simply because it's old and not relevant anymore. This is happening in all areas of our lives. Anyway, in my refund check from Kraft, they thanked me for being a loyal Kraft customer and looked forward to my ntinued support. They are so large that they don't have a clue as to what's going on. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I told that phone jerk that I was boytting ALL products that Kraft makes. I am very angry that they messed with this dressing. I have found an alternative at Wal-Mart. They have their Great Value brand dressing in Honey French and Homestyle French flavors. The better of the two is the Honey French; however, if you mbine the two dressings in equal amounts you have a nice tasting French dressing very similar to Catalina. Of urse, if you go with the Honey French by itself, it is very similar to the Catalina taste. All that said, the old Catalina had the best balance of flavors and zinginess that I liked. It's so sad\n",

When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean.

I usually have brewed ffee with flavored non-dairy creamer. When I saw this product and the Pumpkin Spice variety) available through the Vine program, I thought I would give it a try. It's okay, but nothing great. It's sweet and has a slight peppermint flavor fun for the holidays but really no ffee flavor to speak of. It's certainly not the quality of a latte drink you would get at a ffee shop. On the plus side, it is super easy to make plus sts much less than a latte drink from a ffee shop. The product does not ntain much actual ffee, so it certainly won't give the morning pick-me-up that I have me to expect from my morning ffee. So I think I will stick with my usual brewed ffee with flavored non-dairy creamer in the mornings and the occasional latte or similar drink at the local ffee shop.\n",

Hey, that sounds good, but further box reading shows it ntains sucralose, here is one mment I found about sucralose: Acrding to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, -methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature.

      "Original Review: Update //: I previously posted a review on the Simple Solutions Lamb Rice Formula a few months ago, which I have since deleted. I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets stars at dogfoodanalysis.m, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched. However, my dog was getting nstant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I ntinued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine. When the Lamb Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck Rice formula, which I'm slowly inrporating into the Lamb Rice. He really loves the Duck Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed. Also, the ear infections are mpletely gone. I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog. I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online. Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br ><br >I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.m only gives Wellness Simple Solutions out of stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review stars.

The faux-chicken tastes better than the real chicken in Campbell's which is probably made of chicken beaks anyway). The flavor is just like any canned chicken soup but better. Some people are impossible to please, especially the ones that are newbs at being vegetarian because they're following a fad or trying to impress a guy/girl. Seriously, don't let the negative reviews sway you, the smell emitting from the can is the same as any canned soup, if not less noticeable and the taste is great it's all natural so, unless they got an old can, how uld there be a bad smell). Just knowing that there aren't a bunch of dead animal parts floating around in it is good enough for me. Oh, and it looks better than the pic on the label, way more noodles and carrots.\n",
      "Generated Review: This is healthy, meat free, organic and low fat, what more uld you ask for? The faux-chicken tastes better than the real chicken in Campbell's which is probably made of chicken beaks anyway). The flavor is just like any canned chicken soup but better. Some people are impossible to please, especially the ones that are newbs at being vegetarian because they're following a fad or trying to impress a guy/girl.

Thankfully hubby is home now and feeling much better and as I ntinue with the use of this shampoo I find it doesn't leave my hair greasy or limp like some shampoos with nditioner tend to do.

However, tbsp of PB does not equal tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about tbsp of PB to get full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added tbsp of PB to a Jell-O pudding cup the sugar free and it was delicious It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was points. PB does have a bit of a gritty nsistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me.

I don't even have to leave the house, the package is delivered promptly to my door and my cat not mebr ns that's been for years\"\n",

      "Original Review: This tea is for urinary health. It definitely helps relieve pain. If you have an UTI, this tea does not cure it, but it helps in relieving pain in the urethra. The taste is not the greatest, but it's a medicine tea, so I don't mind, knowing that I will find relief. You need to steep the tea for a half hour and then drink it while its still hot and fresh. Use a few times a day. This tea is from Croatia... a place where they have wonderful herbs for medicinal teas.\n",
